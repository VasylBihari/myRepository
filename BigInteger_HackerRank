/*n this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.
Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.
Input Format
There will be two lines containing two numbers, a  and b.
Constraints
 a and b are non-negative integers and can have maximum  200 digits.
Output Format
Output two lines. The first line should contain a+b, and the second line should contain a*b . Don't print any leading zeros.*/
